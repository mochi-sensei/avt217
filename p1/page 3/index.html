<p>The peonies puffed themselves up in order to be larger than the roses, but size is not everything!</p>
<p>The tulips had the finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for they were standing bolt upright like candles, that one might see them the better.</p>
<p>In their pride they did not see the little daisy, which looked over to them and thought,</p>
<p>“How rich and beautiful they are! I am sure the pretty bird will fly down and call upon them. Thank God, that I stand so near and can at least see all the splendour.”</p>
<p>And while the daisy was still thinking, the lark came flying down, crying “Tweet,” but not to the peonies and tulips—no, into the grass to the poor daisy.</p>
<p>Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think. The little bird hopped round it and sang,</p>
<p>“How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here.”</p>
