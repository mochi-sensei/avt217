<p>On the following morning, when the flower once more stretched forth its tender petals, like little arms, towards the air and light, the daisy recognised the birdâ€™s voice,</p>

<p>but what it sang sounded so sad.</p>

<p>Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window. It sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about, of fresh green corn in the fields, and of the time when it could soar almost up to the clouds.</p>

<p>The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage. The little daisy would have liked so much to help it, but what could be done?</p>
<p>Indeed, that was very difficult for such a small flower to find out. It entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was, how warmly the sun was shining, and how splendidly white its own petals were.</p>
<p>It could only think of the poor captive bird, for which it could do nothing. Then two little boys came out of the garden; one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips.</p>
<p>They came straight towards the little daisy, which could not understand what they
