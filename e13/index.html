      <p>2) Create a 1000x1000 canvas in XD</p>
      <p>3) Create a square that is 531x531 in the middle of the canvas. It has to be filled with grey.</p>
      <p>4) Create two, white circles with black outlines. Put them on the box, as if they are eyes.</p>
      <p>5) Create a rectangle that is 208x330, and put it underneath the box. Make sure that it is filled with grey.</p>
      <p>6) Create a rectangle that is 74x112 and put it underneath the 208x330 box, and move it to the left where the corner of that rectangle meets the corner of the 208x330. Make sure that it is filled with grey.</p>
      <p>7) Duplicate the 74x112 box and move it over to the right, making the corner of that box meet the 208x330 corner, like the first 74x112 box. Make sure it's filled with grey. It also looks like feet!</p>
